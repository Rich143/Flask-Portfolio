The elephant in the room is changing jobs after 7 months of working. Here's how it went.

#### The first few weeks
Being done with Caltech was like a breath of fresh air masking a lingering emptiness. Going out with
a bang - Neural Computation, Microprocessor Systems, and Differential Privacy - was something to be proud of.

But doing school all backwards, slacking the first two years and then finally finding a purpose was
not.

Moving to Santa Clara was abrupt. The room was cold, and friends were few in number. But I was
happy.

#### Spring
Working on Solaris proved to be a grind, and it was time to seek change. I began interviewing as
aggressively as I could. Rejection was painful, but in hindsight responsible for the progress made
until this point. In other words... you only live once, but you may apply multiple times.

#### Summer
Silicon Valley was a strange place. So many companies claimed to change the world but only bettered
the lives of the top 10%. The more interviews I went through, the more I realized this. Founders
needed VCs. VCs need a return on investment, and only the most world-changing companies that touch
millions of users could be worth enough. Furthermore, companies needed engineers, and changing the
world was a perk.

Disruption was a big word to throw around, but *what does it actually mean?* Disruption is altering
something fundamental about the system, causing other components to move and shift in response.

> me: How are you going to change education?

> company: We're going to teach kids. With computers.

> me: What's your endgame?

> company: We're revolutionizing education. We think you could really grow a lot here.

Vision was another big word.

I thought for a bit about these subjects then procrastinated by playing Witcher 3.

#### Changing jobs
The reason why Square was so attractive was that it realized that it was in a crowded space:
payments. Moving money around and skimming a bit off the top is a lucrative business, and Square
was helping others pay. The act of paying for goods and services is something almost everyone in
this country is used to. Readers, point of sales, and more had all been done.

Square pivoted and began helping small businesses. Unlike payments alone, this venture had
synergistic goals with the clients. If small businesses grow, so does Square's revenue.

There was also enough in it for me. Platform engineering and Mobile CI had a lot of work to be done.
New build systems, unresolved technical debt, and products demanded our attention.

#### Working until winter
The first few months of Square were difficult. Commuting four hours a day from the South Bay meant
much less free time. Work consumed everything except sleep. I thought a lot about my parents who had
much worse conditions after graduating college, which caused me to stop caring about my whimpy
discomfort.

Imposter syndrome loomed over me. Open sourcing a tool in the first month provided some validation,
but my peers' level of familiarity with our systems was much better than mine. There was a little
more to this company than just doing my due dilligence.

Free time returned after moving to Burlingame, a town 30 minutes from work.

I can't think of anything I regret. Maybe if I have done all of this sooner :)
