If you have a good interview question and have an engaging candidate, giving technical
interviews is fun. There's a lot you can do to minimize cases where it is not.

#### Question Design
The focus of the interview is the question. If the candidate doesn't do well or you don't learn
anything about the candidate, it'll be hard to make a case for a hire. A good question is:

1. **Language agnostic.** If the question requires the use of builtins or libs, make sure that they're
available in the languages you're interviewing in.
2. **Peer tested.** A question should be as clear and fair as possible. Testing with peers can smooth
this out so candidates aren't mislead.
3. **Layered.** The question should have levels, and the candidate should feel accomplished even if
they just solve the first part.

#### The Interview
Interviewing is half preparation and half execution.

1. **Talk to the candidate** as their coding. Ask them about alternative approaches they could be taking
and potential tradeoffs.
2. **Reassure** them that the interview should be a conversation.
3. **Encourage** them. A lot of candidates feel nervous, and a "that seems like a good approach" goes a
long way.

#### Feedback
Develop a rubric or guidelines to assess the candidate. Making a yes or no decision isn't too hard,
but the *why* is important.
