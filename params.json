Fill out info.py.\r\n2. Place a resume into `static/assets/resume.pdf`.\r\n3. Place a banner image in `static/images/banner.jpg`.\r\n4. Place an icon image in `static/images/ico/favicon.ico`.\r\n5. Comment out `application.debug = True` in `application.py`.\r\n6. Deploy to the platform of your choice. We are ready for Elastic Beanstalk.\r\n\r\n### Deploying to Elastic Beanstalk\r\nDeploying in Elastic Beanstalk is a simple process you can learn more about [here][2]. I can't speak\r\nfor other operating systems, but this repo has been tested on OSX.\r\n\r\n\r\n### License\r\n    The MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\n    Copyright (c) 2016 James Chang\r\n\r\n    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\n    of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\n    in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\n    to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\n    copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\n    furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\n    The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\n    copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\n    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\n    IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\n    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
