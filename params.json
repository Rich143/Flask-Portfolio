{"name":"Flask-Portfolio","tagline":"Website and portfolio template constructed with flask and bootstrap.","body":"### Flask-Portfolio\r\n[![Twitter: @longboardcat13](https://img.shields.io/badge/contact-@longboardcat13-blue.svg?style=flat)](https://twitter.com/longboardcat13)\r\n[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/longboardcat/Flask-Portfolio/blob/master/LICENSE)\r\n\r\nThis repo is a website template that includes a projects section and blog.\r\n\r\n### How to test:\r\n```\r\n$ pip install Flask Flask-Markdown\r\n\r\n$ python applications.py\r\n\r\n$ open http://127.0.0.1:5000/\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt should look something like [this][1].\r\n\r\n\r\n### What you need to do:\r\nIn order to populate the templates on your websites, you will need to fill out template files and\r\nadd two images.\r\n\r\n1. Fill out info.py.\r\n2. Place a resume into `static/assets/resume.pdf`.\r\n3. Place a banner image in `static/images/banner.jpg`.\r\n4. Place an icon image in `static/images/ico/favicon.ico`.\r\n5. Comment out `application.debug = True` in `application.py`.\r\n6. Deploy to the platform of your choice. We are ready for Elastic Beanstalk.\r\n\r\n### Blogging\r\nTo blog, place markdown files in `static/assets/posts`. Their filenames should be formatted:\r\n`YYYY-MM-DD-Title-Goes-Here.md`. Feel free to change the logic in `blog.py`.\r\n\r\n### Deploying to Elastic Beanstalk\r\nDeploying in Elastic Beanstalk is a simple process you can learn more about [here][2]. I can't speak\r\nfor other operating systems, but this repo has been tested on OSX.\r\n\r\n[1]: http://www.jameschang.io/\r\n[2]: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create-deploy-python-flask.html\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
